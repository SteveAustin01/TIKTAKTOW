This Tic Tac Toe game includes a smart computer opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to make the best possible moves, making it tough to beat. The game starts with an empty 3x3 board, and players take turns based on how many moves have been made. The computer identifies which spots on the board are free and considers each possible move, looking for ways to win or block the player. It checks rows, columns, and diagonals to see if someone has won or if the game is a draw. If the game is over, a score is given: 1 if X wins, -1 if O wins, and 0 if itâ€™s a draw. The Minimax algorithm then chooses the best move by evaluating all possible outcomes for both players, using a method called alpha-beta pruning to avoid unnecessary calculations. This makes the computer a challenging opponent, as it will always make the most strategic moves, ensuring a fair but tough game.
